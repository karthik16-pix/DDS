Stack :	It is collection of elements arranged one above the other
	A stack is commonly represnted in a vertical form
	The arrangement of values in a stack will be from bottom to top
Stack Rule is LIFO Last In First Out   OR   also called as FILO First In Last Out
	The last element which is inserted into the stack will be
	first element to be removed.

-To manage the stack: 
--->we use an int variable called "top" whose initial value is -1
    It is used to identify the index position of the top most element
--->we use an int variable called "limit" to identify the last index of the stack.

-push()  : The process of adding elements into the stack is called push() operation.
-pop()   : The process of deleting elements from the stack is called pop() operation.
-display():The process of showing all available value of stack is called display().

In push operation:
-When we add an element, we increment top by 1
-When we increment top, there is a possibility of a situation called "Overflow"
-Overflow is when there is no space to add an element into the stack (stack is FULL)

In pop operation:
-When we delete an element, we decrement top by 1
-When we decrement top, there is a possibility of a situation called "Underflow"
-Underflow is when there is no element in the stack (stack is EMPTY)

In display operation:
-When the stack is NOT underflow then we run a loop to show the values 
  from stack[0] to stack[top]

Algorithm to perform a push operation on a stack:
Step 1:	Increment the variable top by 1
Step 2:	Check for overflow [condition is top>limit]
Step 3:	If YES, then show a message "Stack Overflow", 
	decrement top by 1 and also go to step 5
Step 4:	If NO, accept the user input into stack[top]
Step 5:	STOP

Algorithm to perform a pop operation on a stack:
Step 1:	Check for underflow [condition is top==-1 or top<0]
Step 2:	If YES, then show a message "Stack Underflow", go to step 5
Step 3:	If NO, display the value present in stack[top]
Step 4: decrement top by 1
Step 5:	STOP

Algorithm to perform a display operation on a stack:
Step 1:	Check for underflow [condition is top==-1 or top<0]
Step 2:	If YES, then show a message "Stack Underflow", go to step 4
Step 3:	If NO, display the values from stack[0] to stack[top]
Step 4: STOP














FIFO : First In Frst Out
	The very first element which is inserted into the stack will be
	first element to be removed
